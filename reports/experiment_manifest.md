| 4 | 45 | ICAIF-format paper package | Required before external submission | anonymous eight-page ACM paper and citation/claim audits |

## Minimal Ablation Definition

Phase 25 includes only the ablations needed to support or falsify the current paper mechanism:

| Ablation | Question |
|---|---|
| Vanilla contrastive vs HMM-guided contrastive | Does weak HMM supervision improve learned structure? |
| GMM vs HMM assignment on embeddings | Does sequential assignment matter after representation learning? |
| Time-only vs time-frequency guided encoder | Does the FFT view improve or dilute the guided representation? |
| Encoder depth if compute allows | Is the result sensitive to a minimal architecture change? |

The completed Phase 25 table supports the assignment-layer mechanism most strongly and does not justify expanding time-frequency downstream compute yet. Phase 26 preserves the paper-safe read: HMM assignment is the strongest supported mechanism, while guided-HMM versus raw-feature HMM remains directional rather than statistically decisive. Hard-negative mining remains optional unless the formal paper draft exposes a mechanism gap.

## Submission Readiness Checklist

The project is submission-ready only when:

1. Phase 38 control files exist and classify all inspected evidence as development-observed.
2. Phase 25 ablation artifacts exist and are discussed.
3. Phase 26 refreshed statistical evidence exists.
4. Phase 27 paper skeleton and artifact map exist.
5. Phase 28 reproduction commands and artifact policy docs exist.
6. Phase 29 prose pass preserves the claims allowed by `reports/claim_registry.md`.
7. The paper draft uses only claims allowed by `reports/claim_registry.md`.
8. The validation audit passes with no critical failures.
9. Reproduction commands are documented.
10. The learned encoder and all downstream decisions are fully fold-local.
11. Missing vanilla learned Crypto-20 baselines are present with equal coverage.
12. One candidate is frozen before locked external evaluation.
13. The final paper follows the current venue page, anonymity, citation, and self-containment rules.
