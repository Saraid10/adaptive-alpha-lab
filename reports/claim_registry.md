# Adaptive Alpha Lab Claim Registry

## Purpose

This registry separates allowed paper claims from claims that are not supported by the current evidence. It should be consulted before editing the README, report, dashboard, paper draft, or resume bullets.

## Claim Status Levels

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Supported | Evidence is strong enough for the main text with normal caveats. |
| Directional | Point estimates or diagnostics support the idea, but statistical evidence is incomplete. |
| Diagnostic | Useful for explanation or mechanism, not a causal or predictive claim. |
| Open | Not tested yet. |
| Forbidden | Should not be claimed. |

## Supported Claims

| Claim | Status | Evidence Artifact | Safe Wording |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vanilla contrastive-GMM regimes are weak in this benchmark. | Supported | `models/walkforward_experiment_results.csv`, `models/regime_quality_summary.csv`, `models/statistical_claims.csv` | Vanilla contrastive regimes underperform raw-feature HMM and show weak alignment with the HMM reference. |
| Sequential assignment matters. | Supported | `models/guided_alpha_comparison.csv`, `models/guided_encoder_comparison.csv`, `models/paper_statistical_summary.csv` | Learned embeddings are more useful when the assignment layer preserves temporal state dynamics. |
| HMM-guided supervision improves structural regime alignment. | Supported | `models/guided_encoder_summary.csv`, `models/guided_encoder_comparison.csv` | HMM-guided weak supervision substantially increases agreement with the raw-feature HMM reference. |
| Guided-HMM is stress-robust on the primary BTC+ETH 8h prediction file. | Supported | `models/robustness_stress_summary.csv`, `models/robustness_stress_wins.csv` | Guided-HMM is the most frequent winner in the refreshed primary stress grid. |
| Guided-HMM feature attribution is economically plausible. | Diagnostic | `models/feature_importance_by_regime.csv`, `models/feature_family_summary.csv` | Fold-local interpretability shows the alpha model relies mainly on volatility state, momentum/autocorrelation, and distribution shape. |
| HMM assignment is the strongest current ablation mechanism. | Supported | `models/ablation_summary.csv`, `models/paper_statistical_summary.csv`, `models/ablation_heatmap.png` | Phase 25/26 show the assignment layer is the most consistently supported mechanism across structural and downstream comparisons. |
| Structural regime-learning behavior transfers to Crypto-20. | Supported structurally | `models/crypto20_guided_encoder_summary.csv`, `models/crypto20_guided_encoder_comparison.csv` | The guided objective preserves strong sequential structure across the pre-specified Crypto-20 universe; this is a structural, not alpha, claim. |
| Structural quality, ranking, calibration, and portfolio performance are distinct outcomes. | Supported diagnostically | `models/crypto20_statistical_method_summary.csv`, `models/crypto20_statistical_claims.csv`, `reports/crypto20_statistical_protocol.md` | Phase 37 shows that stronger regime alignment and the highest mean fold IC can coexist with inconclusive dominance, worse calibration, and weak portfolio performance. |

## Directional Claims

| Claim | Status | Evidence Artifact | Safe Wording |
|---|---|---|---|
| Guided-HMM improves downstream alpha over raw-feature HMM. | Directional | `models/walkforward_experiment_results.csv`, `models/ablation_summary.csv`, `models/paper_statistical_summary.csv`, `models/statistical_pairwise_tests.csv`, `models/statistical_claims.csv` | Guided-HMM improves point estimates over raw-feature HMM on the primary benchmark, but Phase 26 confirms the fold-level IC evidence remains statistically inconclusive. |
| Guided-HMM has better risk-adjusted behavior than raw-feature HMM. | Directional | `models/statistical_sharpe_diagnostics.csv`, `models/robustness_stress_summary.csv` | Guided-HMM has the strongest PSR diagnostic and stress-grid performance, but this is not a deployable performance claim. |

## Diagnostic Claims

| Claim | Status | Evidence Artifact | Safe Wording |
|---|---|---|---|
| Structural regime-learning behavior transfers beyond BTC/ETH. | Diagnostic | `models/crypto20_guided_encoder_summary.csv`, `models/crypto20_guided_encoder_comparison.csv`, `reports/multiasset_universe_plan.md` | Phase 35 shows the HMM-guided objective scales structurally to Crypto-20, but this is not evidence of downstream alpha generalization. |
| Repaired classical Crypto-20 baselines are weak/negative. | Diagnostic | `models/crypto20_repaired_classical_experiment_results.csv`, `models/crypto20_repaired_classical_fold_metrics.csv`, `reports/phase39r_classical_baseline_protocol.md` | On the repaired frozen development panel, global and raw-regime LightGBM baselines do not show convincing positive alpha under mean per-asset IC and non-overlapping cost-adjusted portfolio diagnostics. |
| Repaired neural/guided Crypto-20 baselines are weak/inconclusive. | Diagnostic | `models/crypto20_repaired_fold_local_experiment_results.csv`, `models/crypto20_repaired_fold_local_fold_metrics.csv`, `reports/phase39r_neural_fold_local_results.md` | On the repaired frozen development panel, vanilla contrastive, contrastive-HMM, and HMM-guided fold-local methods do not show convincing positive alpha or robust dominance over simpler repaired baselines. |
| Phase 40 repaired statistical adjudication rejects a robust dominance claim. | Diagnostic | `models/crypto20_repaired_fold_local_statistical_method_summary.csv`, `models/crypto20_repaired_fold_local_statistical_claims.csv`, `reports/phase40_repaired_statistical_adjudication.md` | Corrected Phase 40 tests do not support IC/Sharpe superiority for repaired guided or contrastive methods; all alpha claims must remain weak, diagnostic, and development-observed. |
| Phase 41 registers bounded improvement candidates without claiming improvement. | Diagnostic | `configs/phase41_bounded_candidates_v1.json`, `models/phase41_candidate_registry.csv`, `models/phase41_selection_rules.csv`, `reports/phase41_bounded_improvement_protocol.md` | Phase 41 defines calibration, soft-gating, and deferred score-threshold execution-control candidates whose parameters must be selected only by inner validation; it is not evidence that any candidate improves alpha. |
| Phase 41B runner is implementation infrastructure, not a result. | Diagnostic | `src/phase41_inner_validation_candidates.py`, `tests/test_phase41_inner_validation_candidates.py` | The Phase 41B runner supports inner-validation-selected probability-calibration and soft-gating candidate experiments for the global/classical ladder. Score-threshold execution control is registered but deferred. Smoke outputs are engineering diagnostics only; a full development run is required before comparing candidates. |
| Phase 41B full global/classical candidate run does not improve the alpha conclusion. | Diagnostic | `models/phase41_classical_experiment_results.csv`, `models/phase41_classical_statistical_claims.csv`, `reports/phase41_inner_validation_candidate_run.md` | The full Phase 41B run shows that bounded inner-validation-selected calibration/soft-gating candidates do not support corrected IC/Sharpe dominance or positive-alpha claims on the repaired development panel. |
| Phase 42 explains the weak repaired-alpha result without rescuing it. | Diagnostic | `models/phase42_execution_stress_summary.csv`, `models/phase42_regime_transition_diagnostics.csv`, `models/phase42_cross_asset_alpha_diagnostics.csv`, `reports/phase42_interpretation_execution_hardening.md` | Phase 42 shows execution sensitivity, regime-transition effects, cross-asset fragility, and weak feature-target alignment on the development panel. It is explanatory evidence only, not a tradability or model-improvement claim. |
| Phase 43A freezes the final locked-holdout protocol. | Diagnostic / protocol freeze | `configs/phase43_locked_holdout_freeze_v1.json`, `models/phase43_locked_candidate_manifest.csv`, `models/phase43_locked_claim_rules.csv`, `reports/phase43_locked_holdout_freeze.md` | The guided-HMM mechanism path is frozen before locked evaluation. Phase 41B calibration, soft-gating, threshold control, and new model search are excluded from the final candidate. No locked outcome has been inspected. |
| Phase 43B registration shows whether the locked holdout is ready. | Diagnostic / registration gate | `configs/phase43b_locked_holdout_registration_v1.json`, `models/phase43b_locked_holdout_registration_manifest.csv`, `models/phase43b_holdout_candidate_quality.csv`, `reports/phase43b_locked_holdout_registration.md` | Registration uses only data coverage and quality checks. It does not inspect predictions, alpha metrics, method rankings, or locked-holdout performance. A blocked status means more external data must be ingested before evaluation. |
| The frozen guided-HMM mechanism receives limited locked-holdout support. | Confirmatory / limited | `models/phase43b_locked_external_experiment_results.csv`, `models/phase43b_locked_external_primary_comparison.csv`, `models/phase43b_locked_external_claims.csv`, `reports/phase43b_locked_external_adjudication.md` | The final candidate improves over `global_lgbm` and `regime_lgbm_hmm` on locked mean asset IC and has non-worse locked Sharpe with equal coverage. This does not support a tradable-positive alpha claim because final Sharpe and total return are negative. |

## Open Claims

| Claim | Status | Required Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Time-frequency guided encoding improves the full model. | Open | Full-length time-frequency run plus downstream alpha retest; Phase 25 says not to expand this yet. |
| Hard-negative mining improves guided regimes. | Open | Capped ablation suite. |
| Downstream alpha results generalize beyond BTC/ETH. | Directional only | Phase 37 gives guided-HMM the highest mean fold IC, but the edge is not significant after paired testing or correction; Sharpe/return dominance is unsupported. |
| Fold-local encoder retraining changes the conclusion. | Diagnostic | The repaired 16-fold development run is complete. It weakens the earlier alpha story: downstream alpha remains weak/inconclusive under calendar-safe validation. |
| The repaired neural/guided encoder beats the repaired classical baselines. | Unsupported | The repaired full run does not show robust positive alpha or convincing guided-method dominance over the repaired classical baselines. |
| Validation-only calibration repairs guided-HMM NLL without reducing IC. | Open | Inner-validation calibration followed by fully fold-local outer evaluation. |
| Soft regime gating improves transition behavior. | Open | Pre-specified hard-versus-soft gating comparison on development folds. |
| The selected method transfers to an untouched holdout. | Open | One frozen configuration evaluated once on a registered locked asset or temporal holdout. |

## Forbidden Claims

| Claim | Why Forbidden |
|---|---|
| HMM states are true market regimes. | HMM states are proxy/reference states, not ground-truth labels. |
| The trading strategy is profitable. | Backtest returns are research diagnostics with limited assets and overlapping labels. |
| Guided-HMM statistically dominates raw-feature HMM. | The current fold-level IC edge is not significant at 5%. |
| The result generalizes to equities, FX, or commodities. | The expanded tests are still crypto-only and do not cover other asset classes. |
| The result statistically improves downstream alpha on Crypto-20. | Unsupported. Phase 37 IC confidence intervals cross zero and corrected tests do not establish superiority over global, raw HMM, or KMeans. |
| The guided model is better calibrated on Crypto-20. | Unsupported. Time-block DM tests show worse multiclass NLL than global LightGBM and raw-feature HMM. |
| SHAP proves causal market drivers. | Feature attribution is model-specific and diagnostic. |
| Offline/global regime assignments prove predictive performance. | Predictive claims require fold-local regime refits. |
| Existing Crypto-20 results are an untouched final test. | Phase 36/37 outcomes have already been inspected and are development-observed under the Phase 38 data-role policy. |

## Phase 38 Claim Control

The source of truth for data roles is `reports/data_role_registry.csv`; the source of truth for tried and planned experiment families is `reports/experiment_ledger.csv`. New README, paper, dashboard, resume, or presentation language must remain inside both registries and the gates in `reports/publication_acceptance_gates.md`.

## Phase 39 Claim Control

Allowed: the repaired pipeline passes common-calendar alignment, strict pooled timestamp separation, causal-encoding, atomic-checkpoint, resume-lineage, and equal-coverage smoke checks.

Forbidden: interpreting the one-fold, one-epoch Phase 39 metric table as evidence that any method is better or worse. A full development run can update development claims only; it cannot restore untouched-test status to Crypto-20.

The earlier full run is computationally complete but scientifically invalidated: 95% of each fold's test rows overlapped the pooled training calendar. Its metrics may be retained only as debugging history. Forbidden: using them for superiority, inferiority, calibration, profitability, or generalization claims.

The repaired classical full run, repaired neural/guided full run, and Phase 40 repaired statistical adjudication are complete and valid as development-observed benchmarks. They support only diagnostic claims: repaired classical baselines are weak/negative, repaired neural/guided methods remain weak/inconclusive, and no repaired method currently supports a robust positive-alpha or dominance claim.

The Phase 41B global/classical candidate run is also complete and valid as a development-observed benchmark. It is a controlled negative result: bounded inner-validation calibration and soft-gating candidates do not currently support a robust positive-alpha or dominance claim. Score-threshold execution-control candidates remain deferred and cannot be claimed as tested by Phase 41B.

Phase 42 is complete as a diagnostic explanation layer. It may be used to explain why alpha is weak, but it must not be used to tune directly against development outer-fold outcomes or to claim tradability.

Phase 43A freezes `regime_lgbm_hmm_guided_hmm` as the final locked-holdout mechanism candidate. This is not a result. It only authorizes a future single locked evaluation under the written rules.

Phase 43B registration is a readiness gate, not a result. It can authorize locked evaluation only if the registered external holdout has enough quality-eligible assets and recorded hashes before any model outcome is inspected.

Phase 43B locked evaluation is now complete. The paper may say the frozen guided-HMM mechanism receives limited relative support on the pre-specified locked IC/Sharpe rule. The paper must not say it proves a profitable trading strategy, and it must not switch to a non-frozen method after seeing the locked result.

Phase 44 is a paper-readiness and claim-packaging phase, not a model-improvement phase. It converts the repaired development evidence and the locked external holdout into a manuscript draft, evidence matrix, and risk register. It does not authorize new tuning, candidate switching, or reuse of the same locked holdout for model rescue.

Future improvement phases must not tune directly against Phase 40 outer-test outcomes or Phase 41B outer-fold outcomes. Candidate selection must remain inside training/inner-validation windows, and Existing Crypto-20 results are an untouched final test only for claims that were fixed before those results were inspected.
