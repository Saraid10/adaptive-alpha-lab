# Phase 41 Bounded Calibration And Soft-Gating Protocol

## Purpose

Phase 41 is a controlled improvement phase. It registers calibration and soft-gating candidates motivated by Phase 40, but it does **not** tune against Phase 40 outer-test results.

The current data role remains `development_observed`. Candidate selection is restricted to `inner_chronological_validation_only`.

## Why This Phase Exists

Phase 40 found no corrected IC/Sharpe superiority claim and showed weak probability/portfolio behavior. The right response is not to search the already-inspected outer-test table for a nicer result. The right response is to define bounded candidates, select them inside each outer fold using inner validation, and then evaluate the frozen choices once on the outer fold.

## Forbidden Selection Inputs

- `models/crypto20_repaired_fold_local_alpha_oos_predictions.csv`
- `models/crypto20_repaired_fold_local_statistical_claims.csv`
- `models/crypto20_repaired_fold_local_statistical_method_summary.csv`
- `locked_final_test`

## Registered Candidates

| Candidate | Family | Primary selector | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `p41_prob_temperature` | probability_calibration | inner_validation_nll | registered_not_selected |
| `p41_prior_blend` | probability_calibration | inner_validation_nll | registered_not_selected |
| `p41_posterior_temperature` | soft_regime_gating | inner_validation_nll | registered_not_selected |
| `p41_global_regime_shrinkage` | soft_regime_gating | inner_validation_nll | registered_not_selected |
| `p41_score_threshold` | execution_control | inner_validation_nll_then_turnover | registered_not_selected |

## Mandatory Rules

| Rule | Requirement | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `p41_no_outer_test_selection` | Do not select candidate parameters from repaired outer-test predictions or Phase 40 statistical outputs. | mandatory |
| `p41_inner_nll_primary` | Use inner_validation_nll as the primary candidate selector. | mandatory |
| `p41_turnover_guardrail` | Reject candidates that increase turnover by more than 25% versus the fold baseline. | mandatory |
| `p41_equal_coverage` | Reject candidates whose outer-test coverage differs from the repaired baseline. | mandatory |
| `p41_freeze_before_locked_test` | Freeze exactly one candidate before any future locked external evaluation. | mandatory |

## Paper-Safe Interpretation

This phase is infrastructure and protocol, not a performance claim. It makes future improvement attempts auditable by separating:

1. candidate definition,
2. inner-validation selection,
3. outer-fold evaluation,
4. final locked-test evaluation.

If Phase 41 candidates do not improve inner-validation calibration or repaired outer-fold diagnostics, that negative result remains part of the research record.
