# Adaptive Alpha Lab

> A research-grade quant ML benchmark platform that tests whether learned market regimes improve alpha modeling versus global baselines and classical regime methods, using proper financial labels, purged walk-forward validation, and transaction-cost-aware evaluation.

**Live Demo:** [adaptive-alpha-engine.streamlit.app](https://adaptive-alpha-engine.streamlit.app/)

## Key Finding

The strongest current result is not that learned regimes beat every baseline. They do not. The true Gaussian HMM baseline remains the best IC and Sharpe method in the latest BTC+ETH run.

Phase 11 tested the natural research response: fit an HMM on learned contrastive embeddings. The contrastive-HMM hybrid improves the learned-regime path from `IC=-0.0165` to `IC=0.0035` and from `Sharpe=-0.902` to `Sharpe=-0.382`, but it still does not beat the raw-feature HMM. That is the current project insight: HMM-style temporal state structure helps learned embeddings, but representation learning alone is not yet enough.

## Research Question

Does learning market regimes from raw financial time-series features improve alpha-model IC, drawdown, and Sharpe compared with:

- a global model with no regime awareness
- Gaussian HMM regimes
- contrastive-HMM hybrid regimes
- KMeans regimes
- volatility-bucket regimes

The project is intentionally framed as a research benchmark, not a live trading bot. Honest weak or mixed results are part of the contribution.

## Methodology Notes

The primary target is `tb_label_8h`, an 8-hour triple-barrier label with classes `-1`, `0`, and `+1`. The alpha score is `P(+1) - P(-1)`. A prediction becomes a trade only when the neutral class is not dominant and the absolute score exceeds the threshold.

The validation scheme uses expanding walk-forward folds with a 5-day embargo gap between train and test windows. This reduces leakage from overlapping financial labels and makes the model comparison more defensible.

Phase 12 adds a validation audit. The current audit passes all critical checks: required tables, feature/target schema, finite joined rows, 24-row target horizon loss, 18 walk-forward folds, 120-bar embargo, 8-bar label-horizon purge, equal method coverage, prediction/test-fold alignment, experiment-result row counts, fold-local artifact coverage, Phase 14A robustness artifact completeness, Phase 14B stress-grid completeness, Phase 15A statistical artifact completeness, and run-registry snapshot completeness.

The audit also records one methodological warning: the legacy `regime_assignments.csv` artifact is offline/global. Paper-grade predictive regime claims should use the Phase 13 `walkforward_experiment_results.csv` artifact instead.

Phase 13 adds that stricter benchmark. In `walkforward_regimes.py`, the regime assignment layer is refit inside each fold using only training-history rows, then applied to test rows. HMM-based test assignments use an online filtering pass initialized from the training sequence and advanced through the embargo gap. The contrastive encoder remains a frozen offline representation in this phase, but GMM/HMM assignment models on top of those embeddings are fit fold-locally.

Phase 14A adds a compact robustness matrix. The fold-local benchmark is repeated across BTC-only, ETH-only, and BTC+ETH scopes, and across 4h, 8h, and 24h triple-barrier targets. This tests whether the main result is stable across assets and prediction horizons instead of being a single-configuration artifact.

Phase 14B adds stress robustness on top of the fold-local prediction file. It does not retrain the models; it re-scores the same out-of-sample predictions under different signal thresholds, transaction costs, and market-period slices. Bull, sideways, and bear periods are defined from rolling 30-day feature-store returns. This tests whether the benchmark conclusion survives realistic deployment assumptions.

Phase 15.0 adds artifact versioning. Latest files in `models/` are still kept for the dashboard, but frozen baselines are copied into timestamped `runs/` directories with a manifest, SHA-256 hashes, git source ref, and run-index entry. The current frozen baseline is `runs/20260522_phase14b_baseline/`.

Phase 15A adds statistical rigor. It computes fold-level IC, Sharpe, total return, drawdown, and turnover from the fold-local out-of-sample prediction file, then reports bootstrap confidence intervals and paired method tests. It also runs a DM-style Newey-West forecast-loss check on multiclass negative log-likelihood, which is a calibration-oriented complement to the IC and Sharpe tests.

Phase 15B adds multiple-testing discipline. It applies Benjamini-Hochberg and Holm corrections across tested method comparisons, labels each finding as corrected, suggestive, or not significant, and adds Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio diagnostics. This prevents a single attractive p-value from becoming an overclaimed research result.

Dense contrastive regime inference uses stride 1 after the encoder window warmup, so the learned-regime method is compared on the same BTC+ETH row universe as HMM-style, KMeans, and volatility-bucket baselines.

## Latest Benchmark Snapshot

Latest run: BTCUSDT + ETHUSDT, `tb_label_8h`, 25,920 out-of-sample rows per method.

| Method | IC | Sharpe | Drawdown | Note |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| global_lgbm | 0.0024 | -0.506 | -0.688 | no-regime baseline |
| regime_lgbm_contrastive | -0.0165 | -0.902 | -0.909 | learned-regime benchmark |
| regime_lgbm_contrastive_hmm | 0.0035 | -0.382 | -0.852 | learned embeddings with HMM state dynamics |
| regime_lgbm_hmm | 0.0051 | -0.229 | -0.825 | best IC and Sharpe; true hmmlearn HMM |
| regime_lgbm_kmeans | -0.0013 | -1.180 | -0.920 | classical clustering baseline |
| regime_lgbm_vol_bucket | -0.0030 | -0.988 | -0.896 | simple volatility baseline |

The current result is intentionally presented as research evidence, not a profitable trading claim. The true HMM baseline is strongest in this run, while the contrastive-HMM hybrid shows that adding temporal state dynamics substantially improves the learned-regime approach.

The main interpretation is that dense contrastive inference fixed the earlier coverage problem, but unconstrained GMM clustering over high-density embeddings appears misaligned with the alpha target. HMM smoothing on embeddings repairs much of that weakness, but raw-feature HMM still produces the best downstream IC and Sharpe. This suggests useful temporal state structure matters more than embedding capacity or persistence alone.

## Fold-Local Regime Benchmark

Phase 13 reruns the regime-aware benchmark with regime assignment models refit inside each fold. This is stricter than the offline/global regime benchmark above.

| Method | IC | Sharpe | Drawdown | Note |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| global_lgbm | 0.0024 | -0.506 | -0.688 | no-regime baseline |
| regime_lgbm_contrastive | -0.0110 | -0.834 | -0.926 | fold-local GMM on frozen embeddings |
| regime_lgbm_contrastive_hmm | -0.0026 | -0.548 | -0.778 | fold-local HMM on frozen embeddings |
| regime_lgbm_hmm | 0.0051 | -0.340 | -0.710 | best fold-local Sharpe |
| regime_lgbm_kmeans | 0.0072 | -0.728 | -0.860 | best fold-local IC |
| regime_lgbm_vol_bucket | -0.0020 | -0.820 | -0.854 | volatility threshold baseline |

The stricter benchmark changes the story in a useful way: fold-local KMeans has the strongest IC, while raw-feature HMM still has the strongest Sharpe and drawdown profile among regime methods. The learned contrastive-HMM path remains better than contrastive-GMM but is weaker under strict fold-local assignment than it looked in the offline/global regime benchmark.

## Phase 14A Robustness Matrix

Phase 14A repeats the strict fold-local benchmark across 9 grid cells: 3 symbol scopes by 3 target horizons.

| Scope | Target | Best IC Method | Best IC | Best Sharpe Method | Best Sharpe | Lowest Drawdown Method |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| BTCUSDT | tb_label_4h | regime_lgbm_hmm | 0.0016 | regime_lgbm_hmm | -0.993 | regime_lgbm_contrastive |
| BTCUSDT | tb_label_8h | regime_lgbm_kmeans | -0.0034 | regime_lgbm_contrastive | -0.546 | regime_lgbm_contrastive |
| BTCUSDT | tb_label_24h | regime_lgbm_kmeans | 0.0175 | regime_lgbm_contrastive_hmm | -0.211 | regime_lgbm_kmeans |
| ETHUSDT | tb_label_4h | regime_lgbm_vol_bucket | 0.0208 | regime_lgbm_vol_bucket | 0.315 | regime_lgbm_vol_bucket |
| ETHUSDT | tb_label_8h | global_lgbm | 0.0095 | regime_lgbm_contrastive | -0.201 | regime_lgbm_hmm |
| ETHUSDT | tb_label_24h | global_lgbm | 0.0348 | global_lgbm | 0.354 | regime_lgbm_vol_bucket |
| BTCUSDT+ETHUSDT | tb_label_4h | regime_lgbm_vol_bucket | 0.0103 | regime_lgbm_hmm | -0.205 | regime_lgbm_hmm |
| BTCUSDT+ETHUSDT | tb_label_8h | regime_lgbm_kmeans | 0.0072 | regime_lgbm_hmm | -0.340 | global_lgbm |
| BTCUSDT+ETHUSDT | tb_label_24h | regime_lgbm_contrastive_hmm | 0.0311 | regime_lgbm_vol_bucket | 0.321 | regime_lgbm_vol_bucket |

Across the grid, KMeans wins IC most often, HMM wins Sharpe most often, and volatility buckets most often win drawdown. This is stronger research evidence than a single headline result: it shows regime awareness can help, but the best regime method depends on the asset, horizon, and metric being optimized.

## Phase 14B Stress Robustness

Phase 14B reuses the strict fold-local `tb_label_8h` prediction file and stresses the trading layer across:

| Dimension | Values |
|---|---|
| Signal threshold | 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10 |
| Transaction cost | 5 bps, 10 bps, 20 bps |
| Market period | all, bull, sideways, bear |

That creates 48 stress cells and 288 method/cell rows. The goal is not to find a new best backtest; it is to see whether the existing conclusion breaks when practical assumptions change.

| Metric | Most Frequent Winner | Wins |
|---|---|---:|
| Signal IC | regime_lgbm_hmm | 24 |
| Sharpe | regime_lgbm_hmm | 22 |
| Drawdown | global_lgbm | 24 |
| Total return | regime_lgbm_hmm | 18 |

The stress test strengthens the interpretation around HMM regimes: raw-feature HMM is the most robust winner for signal IC, Sharpe, and total return across practical cost/threshold/market-period settings. The global model is the most defensive drawdown winner, especially when transaction costs rise. Contrastive-HMM remains useful in sideways regimes, but it is not yet the dominant learned-regime method.

## Phase 15A/15B Statistical Tests

Phase 15A asks whether the observed method differences are statistically reliable. The test is intentionally conservative: it uses the 18 walk-forward folds as the primary unit for IC and Sharpe tests, then uses a row-level DM-style negative-log-likelihood test as a separate calibration check.

| Method | Mean Fold IC | 95% CI Low | 95% CI High | Positive IC Folds | Mean Fold Sharpe |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| regime_lgbm_hmm | 0.0058 | -0.0135 | 0.0247 | 11 | -0.561 |
| regime_lgbm_kmeans | 0.0035 | -0.0205 | 0.0276 | 8 | -0.720 |
| regime_lgbm_vol_bucket | 0.0004 | -0.0223 | 0.0234 | 10 | -0.818 |
| global_lgbm | -0.0005 | -0.0207 | 0.0209 | 9 | -0.583 |
| regime_lgbm_contrastive_hmm | -0.0063 | -0.0305 | 0.0196 | 7 | -0.908 |
| regime_lgbm_contrastive | -0.0147 | -0.0373 | 0.0095 | 7 | -0.990 |

The statistical read is more cautious than the point-estimate read. HMM has the strongest mean fold IC, but most IC and Sharpe differences versus the global model are not significant at the 5% level. Before correction, plain contrastive-GMM is worse than raw-feature HMM on fold-level IC (`p = 0.035`). After Phase 15B multiple-testing correction, this becomes a suggestive result rather than a hard claim (`BH q = 0.347` within the IC family). This supports the current research direction without overclaiming: the next improvement should not simply add a larger encoder; it should add better temporal/state constraints to the learned representation.

## Current Status

The codebase now produces offline/global and fold-local regime benchmarks, a validation audit, Phase 14A symbol/horizon robustness, Phase 14B cost/threshold/period stress robustness, a frozen baseline run registry, Phase 15A/15B statistical significance and multiple-testing artifacts, and a Streamlit research dashboard. The next important work is not live trading; it is regime-quality metrics, encoder ablations, and testing whether better learned embeddings can close the remaining gap against simple fold-local baselines.
